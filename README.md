# border-preview

To be honest this wasn't intended to be this complex.😅

I just wanted to experiment how borders work properly and ended up making this cool website. 😎

I will try to add more features and fix some bugs (If there are some) and make this project go live to help other developers out there

# Planned features
- Add CSS preview ✔️
- Add Copy code ✔️
- Add Advanced control so you can choose from px, rem, em, etc  
- Include Range editor in the advanced settings to you are not limited to 100px only
